This repository contains tools created in order to study digitized rigid motions on 2D and 3D
regular grids.  The code is not yet of any good quality and I am still in the process of releasing
some tools written during the last three years. Some tools need to be adjusted before releasing them
in order to remove some specific functions or to fix incompatibilities with new versions of
libraries like Qt. Please, submit any suggestions or discovered bugs
via the issue tracker.

In most of the cases you will need Qt and [libDGtal](http://dgtal.org) to compile a specific tool.
